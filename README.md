## Focus

If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

I would love to learn more about UI design and implementation, practicing advanced css and practice talking to other, communication. I want to learn about code architectures in a bigger agency and how to manage data at an enterprise level. But most importantly I want to explore my strength within a team setting.

# Code Challenge

## 2020 Internship Menu Exercise

Tackle the following steps to create a menu for a "Fancy Italian Restaurant".

## 1. Sorting

- In `index.js`, loop over `menuItems` and categorize them into sections based on each items assigned `type`
- Sort the items in each category by their `menuOrder`

## 2. Rendering

- Render the sorted results into the appropriate container with `index.html`
- Format any prices. For example, 8.5 becomes \$8.50
- Render the "spicy" icon next to any menu items where `spicy` is `true`

## 3. Styling

- Add some "italian menu" styling to boost your stores sales. Use Google Images if you need inspiration.

## 4. BONUS: Filtering

- Add a checkbox to toggle spicy options. When the checkbox is checked, the spicy options should be visible. It should be checked by default.
